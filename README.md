This is a simplified Amazon clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It features product browsing, a product detail page, and a shopping cart that persists using local storage. 
The project aims to replicate a basic e-commerce interface, providing users with the ability to add products to their cart and review them later.
